# Django MagicLink


Passwordless Authentication for Django with Magic Links.

This package was created with a focus on [ease of setup](#steps-to-impliment), [security](#security) and testing (coverage is currently at 100%). The idea is to use sane defaults to quickly create secure single-use token authentication for Django.

## Install

```bash
pip install django-magiclink
```


## Setup

The setup of the app is simple but has a few steps and a few templates that need overriding.

1. [Install the app](#install)
1. [Configure the app](#configuration) adding urls and settings. There are also a number of [additional configuration settings](#configuration-settings)
1. [Set up the login page](#login-page) by overriding the login page template
1. [Override the login sent page HTML](#login-sent-page)
1. [Customise the login failed page](#login-failed-page)
1. [Set up the magic link email](#magic-link-email) (optional) by setting the email logo and colours. It's also possible to override the email templates
1. [Create a signup page](#signup-page) (optional) depending on your settings configuration


### Basic login flow

1. The user signs up via the sign up page
1. They enter their email on the login page to request a magic link
1. A magic link is sent to users email address
1. The user is redirected to a login sent page
1. The user clicks on the magic link in their email
1. The user is logged in and redirected


*If you want to create a different passwordless login flow see the [Manual usage](#manual-usage) section*


#### Configuration

Add to the `urlpatterns` in `urls.py`:
```python
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('auth/', include('magiclink.urls', namespace='magiclink')),
    ...
]
```

Add `magiclink` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'magiclink',
    ...
)
```

```python
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'magiclink.backends.MagicLinkBackend',
    ...
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
)
```
*Note: MagicLinkBackend should be placed at the top of AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS* to ensure it is used as the primary login backend.


Add the following settings to your `settings.py` (you will need to replace the template names in the below steps):
```python
# Set Djangos login URL to the magiclink login page
LOGIN_URL = 'magiclink:login'
```

See [additional configuration settings](#configuration-settings) for all of the different available settings.


#### Login page

When overriding this template please ensure the following code is included:

```html
<form action="{% url 'magiclink:login' %}{% if request.GET.next %}?next={{ request.GET.next }}{% endif %}" method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ login_form }}
    <button type='submit'>Send login email</button>
</form>
```

See the login docs if you want to create your own login view


#### Login sent page

After the user has requested a magic link, they will be redirected to a success page. It is advised you return a simple message telling the user to check their email:

```html
<h1>Check your email</h1>
<p>We have sent you a magic link to your email address</p>
<p>Please click the link to be logged in automatically</p>
```


#### Login failed page

If the user tries to use an invalid magic token they will be shown a custom error page.

The reasons for the login failing is passed through as the context variable `{{ login_error }}`

To help tailor the error page and explain the possible reasons the user could not login the following context variables are provided:

* `{{ login_error }}` - The reason the login failed (raised by `MagicLink.validate_magiclink()`)


For an example of this page see the [default login failed template](https://github.com/lorddaedra/django-magiclink/blob/master/magiclink/templates/magiclink/login_failed.html)


#### Magic link email

The login email which includes the magic link needs to be configured. By default, a simple HTML template is used. You can override the template (see below)

If this email template is not to your liking you can override the email templates (one for text and one for html). If you override these templates the following context variables are available:

* `{{ subject }}` - The subject of the email "Your login magic link"
* `{{ magiclink }}` - The magic link URL
* `{{ user }}` - The full user object
* `{{ expiry }}` - Datetime for when the magiclink expires
* `{{ ip_address }}` - The IP address of the person who requested the magic link
* `{{ date_created }}` - Datetime of when the magic link was created


#### Signup page

On successful signup the user will be sent a login email with a magic link.

Note: we expect you use custom `User` with `id` field value generated by `timeflake` library. We use `id` field value to generate `username`.
Check `tests/models.py` and `magiclink/services.py`. Use custom view if you need something else.

When overriding this template please ensure the following content is included:

```html
<form action="{% url 'magiclink:signup' %}" method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ signup_form }}
    <button type='submit'>Signup</button>
</form>
<p>Already have an account? <a href='{% url 'magiclink:login' %}'>Log in here</a></p>
```

Like the login for the sign up flow can be overridden if you require more information from the user on signup. See the login/setup docs for more details.


#### Configuration settings

Below are the different settings that can be overridden. To do so place the setting into your `settings.py`.

*Note: Each of the url / redirect settings can either be a URL or url name*

```python

# Set Djangos login redirect URL to be used once the user opens the magic link
# This will be used whenever a ?next parameter is not set on login
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/accounts/profile/'

# If a new user is created via the signup page use this setting to send them to
# a different url than LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL when clicking the magic link
# This will fall back to LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL
MAGICLINK_SIGNUP_LOGIN_REDIRECT = '/welcome/'

# Change the url a user is redirect to after requesting a magic link
MAGICLINK_LOGIN_SENT_REDIRECT = 'magiclink:login_sent'

# Salt used for token signing
MAGICLINK_REGISTRATION_SALT = 'magiclinks'
```


## Security

Using magic links can be dangerous as poorly implemented login links can be brute-forced and emails can be forwarded by accident. There are several security measures used to mitigate these risks:

* The one-time password issued will be valid for 5 minutes before it expires
* The user's email is specified alongside login tokens to stop URLs being brute-forced
* Each login token will be at least 20 digits
* Each one-time link can only be used once
* Only the last one-time link issued will be accepted. Once the latest one is issued, any others are invalidated.

*Note: Each of the above settings can be overridden / changed when configuring django-magiclink*


## Manual usage

django-magiclink uses a model to help create, send and validate magic links. A `create_magiclink` helper function can be used easily create a MagicLink using the correct settings:

```python

from django.contrib.sites.shortcuts import get_current_site
from magiclink.services import create_magiclink, generate_url, send_magiclink
from magiclink.utils import get_client_ip


# Returns newly created from magiclink.models.MagicLink instance
magiclink = create_magiclink(email=email, ip_address=get_client_ip(request), redirect_url='')

# Generates the magic link url and sends it in an email
send_magiclink(ml=magiclink, domain=get_current_site(request).domain, subject='Your login magic link')

# If you want to build the magic link from the model instance but don't want to
#  send the email you can you can use:
magic_link_url = generate_url(token=magiclink.token, email=magiclink.email, domain=get_current_site(request).domain)
```
